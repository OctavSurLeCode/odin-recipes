        <p>For 8 servings:</p>
        <ul>
    <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
    <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
    <li>1/2 cup water</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
    <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>12 cooked lasagna noodles</li>
        </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the ground beef, onion, and garlic until brown. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, water, sugar, basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
     
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Layer with 3 noodles, 1/3 of the meat sauce, 1/3 of the mozzarella, and 1/3 of the Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers twice more.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
