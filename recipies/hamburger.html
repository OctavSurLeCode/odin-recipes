        <p>For 4 servings:</p>
        <ul>
    <li>1 pound ground beef (80% lean)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup breadcrumbs</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>1/4 cup grated onion</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <li>4 hamburger buns, split</li>
    <li>Lettuce leaves, tomato slices, onion slices, pickles, and condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayo) for topping</li>
        </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, breadcrumbs, egg, grated onion, minced garlic, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper. Mix until well combined.</li>
     
        <li>Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and shape each portion into a patty, about 3/4 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Place the burger patties on the grill and cook for 4-5 minutes per side, or until they reach your desired level of doneness.</li>
        <li>During the last minute of cooking, place the hamburger buns, cut side down, on the grill to lightly toast.</li>
        <li>Remove the burger patties and buns from the grill. Assemble the burgers by placing a patty on each bottom bun, then topping with lettuce leaves, tomato slices, onion slices, pickles, and your favorite condiments. Place the top bun on each burger and serve immediately.</li>
